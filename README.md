# 🔐 nomopoly - No More Polynomial Commitments!

**nomopoly** is a neural network compiler that creates Zero Knowledge ML (ZKML) systems using **Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR)** and adversarial training. Instead of traditional polynomial commitments, nomopoly uses fixed-size holographic proofs and binary verification to create practical ZK systems for machine learning inference.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🧠 HRR-Based Proof Generation**: Fixed-size proofs using holographic memory regardless of network complexity
- **🎯 Binary Proof Verification**: Verifier learns to distinguish real vs fake proofs  
- **🔒 Frozen Prover Architecture**: Original network + HRR wrapper (never retrained)
- **📊 MNIST Classification**: Real-world example with 14×14 MNIST digit classification
- **⚡ Adversarial Training**: GAN-like training for robust proof systems
- **📈 Comprehensive Metrics**: Binary classification accuracy, score separation, proof authenticity

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nomopoly.git
cd nomopoly

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the package in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### Run the Demo

```bash
# Run the complete HRR demo
python demo.py
```

This will:
1. Demonstrate HRR innovation and fixed-size proof generation
2. Test holographic memory components (circular convolution, binding)
3. Train the binary proof verification system on MNIST
4. Show live proof verification with real vs fake proof scores
5. Generate comprehensive training plots

## 🧠 Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR)

### The Scalability Problem (SOLVED!)

Traditional ZK approaches suffer from proof size explosion:
- Simple network (34K params) → Large proof tensor
- Complex network (1M+ params) → Huge proof tensor (OOM!)

**HRR Solution**: FIXED proof size regardless of network complexity!
- Any network → Proof: `[batch, 64]` (FIXED SIZE!)

### Key HRR Principles

1. **Circular Convolution**: `bind(activation, position) = circular_conv(a, p)`
2. **Superposition Memory**: `memory = 0.95 * old_memory + new_binding`
3. **Fixed Compression**: Any activation tensor → 512D representation
4. **Position Encoding**: Deterministic vectors preserve layer order information

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. ZKProverNet (Frozen)
- **Original MNIST Network** + **HolographicWrapper**
- Generates authentic proofs using holographic memory
- **NEVER TRAINED** - remains frozen throughout process
- Architecture: `OriginalMNISTNet` → `HolographicWrapper` → `(result, proof)`

#### 2. ZKVerifierNet (Binary Classifier)
- Learns to distinguish real proofs from fake proofs
- Input: `(proof, result)` → Output: `verification_score` (0-1)
- Dynamic layer building for flexibility
- Target: >85% binary classification accuracy

#### 3. ZKAdversarialNet (Fake Proof Generator)
- Generates fake proofs that try to fool the verifier
- Separate classifier + dedicated fake proof generator
- Uses neural networks (not HRR) to create distinguishable fakes
- Adversarial training against verifier

### Training Process

**Binary Proof Verification Training**:

1. **Verifier Training**: Learn to output 1 for real proofs, 0 for fake proofs
2. **Adversary Training**: Generate fake proofs that fool verifier (get score close to 1)
3. **Prover**: FROZEN - only generates authentic HRR proofs

**Success Metrics**:
- Binary Classification Accuracy > 85%
- Real Proof Detection > 90%
- Fake Proof Rejection > 80%
- Score Separation > 0.3

## 📊 Usage Example

```python
from nomopoly import ZKProverNet, ZKVerifierNet, ZKAdversarialNet, ZKTrainer

# Create HRR-based networks
input_dim, output_dim, proof_dim = 196, 10, 64  # MNIST 14x14 → 10 classes

prover = ZKProverNet(input_dim, output_dim, proof_dim)      # Frozen HRR prover
verifier = ZKVerifierNet(input_dim, output_dim, proof_dim)  # Binary classifier
adversary = ZKAdversarialNet(input_dim, output_dim, proof_dim)  # Fake proof generator

# Initialize binary proof verification trainer
trainer = ZKTrainer(
    inference_net=prover,    # Frozen
    verifier_net=verifier,   # Learns binary classification
    malicious_net=adversary, # Generates fake proofs
    device="mps"
)

# Train binary proof verification system
stats = trainer.train(num_epochs=50, num_samples=3000)

# Results: Binary accuracy, real detection, fake rejection, score separation
```

## 🔬 Current Implementation: MNIST Classification
