# 🔐 Nomopoly - Modular Zero Knowledge ONNX Compiler

> **"What if we could achieve 99% verification accuracy in seconds, not hours?"**

**Nomopoly** is a breakthrough modular ONNX operation compiler that creates Zero Knowledge Machine Learning (ZKML) systems through **adversarial training** and **per-operation proof generation**. Instead of compiling entire networks, Nomopoly provides drop-in replacement ONNX operations that generate cryptographic authenticity proofs while maintaining identical computational results.

## 🚀 The 99% Accuracy Revolution

Traditional ZKML approaches face a fundamental trade-off: **security vs speed**. EZKL and zkTorch provide mathematical certainty but require hours of compilation. Nomopoly breaks this paradigm with **adaptive adversarial training** that achieves **96.4% average verification accuracy in just 16.8 seconds**.

### ⚡ Lightning Results: 4/6 Operations at 100% Perfect Accuracy

Our latest compilation run demonstrates the power of adaptive training:

| Operation | Final Accuracy | Training Epochs | Time | Achievement |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|------|-------------|
| **ReLU (16×8×8)** | **100.0%** ✨ | 100 | 2.9s | 🏆 Perfect |
| **Flatten (16×4×4)** | **100.0%** ✨ | 108 | 2.5s | 🏆 Perfect |  
| **Gemm (1×256)** | **100.0%** ✨ | 100 | 2.3s | 🏆 Perfect |
| **ReLU (1×256)** | **100.0%** ✨ | 100 | 2.5s | 🏆 Perfect |
| **MaxPool (16×8×8)** | **93.8%** | 100 | 2.5s | 🥇 Excellent |
| **Conv2d (3×8×8)** | **84.4%** | 100 | 4.1s | 🥈 Good |

**🎯 Result**: 66.7% of operations achieved perfect 100% accuracy, with an average of 96.4%

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎯 99% Accuracy Training**: Adaptive training until verifier reaches 99% authenticity detection
- **📦 Drop-in ONNX Replacement**: Compiled operations are functionally identical + proof-capable
- **🔧 Modular Operation Registry**: Each ONNX operation compiled independently with metadata tracking
- **⚔️ Adversarial Training**: Prover vs Verifier vs Adversary for robust proof systems
- **📊 Comprehensive Analytics**: Training plots, metrics tracking, and performance analysis
- **🚀 Automatic Compilation**: Scan any ONNX model and compile all supported operations

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### The Three-Player Game

Nomopoly employs a sophisticated **adversarial training ecosystem** with three neural networks locked in competition:

#### 1. **ONNXOperationWrapper** (The Honest Prover)
```python
# Wraps any ONNX operation to generate proofs
class ONNXOperationWrapper(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        result = self.original_operation(x)     # Original computation
        proof = self.proof_generator(x, result)  # Authenticity proof
        return result, proof  # Drop-in replacement with proof
```

#### 2. **ONNXVerifier** (The Skeptical Judge)
```python
# Learns to distinguish real vs fake proofs
class ONNXVerifier(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, input_data, output_data, proof):
        # Returns score: 1.0 = authentic, 0.0 = fake
        return self.verification_network(input_data, output_data, proof)
```

#### 3. **ONNXAdversary** (The Cunning Forger)
```python
# Generates fake proofs to train robust verifiers
class ONNXAdversary(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, input_data, fake_output):
        # Creates fake proofs that try to fool verifier
        return self.adversarial_network(input_data, fake_output)
```

### The Four Verification Cases

The system trains on four critical scenarios to ensure robust authentication:

```python
# Training cases for comprehensive verification
verification_cases = [
    (real_input, real_output, real_proof, 1.0),      # ✅ Accept authentic
    (real_input, fake_output, fake_proof, 0.0),      # ❌ Reject fake computation + fake proof  
    (real_input, real_output, fake_proof, 0.0),      # ❌ Reject real computation + fake proof
    (real_input, fake_output, real_proof, 0.0),      # ❌ Reject fake computation + real proof
]
```

**Training Objectives**:
- **Prover**: Generate authentic proofs (frozen - never retrained)
- **Verifier**: Achieve 99% accuracy distinguishing real vs fake proofs
- **Adversary**: Generate convincing fake proofs to strengthen verifier

## ⚔️ Adversarial Training Deep Dive

### The Training Battle: A Story of Adaptation

Nomopoly's training process is like watching an evolutionary arms race unfold in real-time:

**Phase 1: Initial Chaos (Epochs 1-20)**
- Verifier starts at ~71% accuracy (barely better than random)
- Adversary generates primitive fake proofs
- Rapid improvement as verifier learns basic patterns

**Phase 2: The Learning Sprint (Epochs 21-60)**
- Verifier accuracy jumps to 90%+ as it discovers key features
- Adversary adapts, creating more sophisticated fakes
- Training dynamics show classic adversarial competition

**Phase 3: Convergence to Mastery (Epochs 61-100+)**
- Verifier achieves 99%+ accuracy on successful operations
- Adversary loss increases dramatically (failing to fool verifier)
- Early stopping triggers when improvement plateaus

### Smart Training Termination

```python
# The intelligence behind adaptive training
if verifier_accuracy >= target_accuracy and epoch >= min_epochs:
    logger.info(f"🎯 Target accuracy {target_accuracy:.1%} reached!")
    break
    
if epochs_without_improvement >= patience and epoch >= min_epochs:
    logger.info(f"⏹️ Early stopping: No improvement for {patience} epochs")
    break
```

**Key Training Metrics**:
- **Verifier Accuracy**: Overall ability to distinguish real vs fake proofs
- **Adversary Fool Rate**: Success rate of fake proofs fooling verifier  
- **Score Separation**: Gap between real proof scores (→1.0) and fake proof scores (→0.0)
- **Training Dynamics**: Evolution of adversarial competition over epochs
